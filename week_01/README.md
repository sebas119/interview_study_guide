# Algorithm Challenges for Beginners - Arrays

So to start off I think you should gain a solid fundamental understanding of arrays. Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in all of programming if not the most.
I'm sure you've used arrays (or lists in python) by now where you use them to store maybe a list of integers or strings (ex : [1, 2, 3] or ["hello", "whats up", "hi"]).

Solve these three array challenges below.
Question 1 - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem
(Problem : printing elements of an array in reversed order)
Question 2 - https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/
(Problem : monotonic array)
Question 3 - https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/
(Problem : find the third maximum number in an array)
Question 4 - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/2d-array/problem
(Problem : printing the max hourglass sum in a 2D array)
Question 5 - https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/
(Problem : Rotate Array)

Solve one of the following array challenges. (Solve both recommended)
Question 6 - https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/
(Problem : Sort Array By Parity)
Question 7 - https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/
(Problem : Flipping an Image)

Arrays are extremely important and are involved in so many technical interviews that it would be strange if they didn't come up during an interview. Knowing how to traverse and manipulate arrays is essential to your success in a technical interview.
If you feel like this stuff is easy I'd say feel free to skip ahead and do some of the later problems.

# Algorithm Challenges for Beginners - Binary Search

If you solved the problems above I feel confident that you have a basic understanding of arrays. Well, now that you know how arrays work, I think it's a great time to introduce binary search. I'm sure you've either heard of it or implemented it before but binary search is so important for technical interviews. There are a bunch of problems that ask you to implement a variation of binary search to solve a specific task and these variation problems often come up in internship interviews. I've personally been asked a binary search question during an actual technical interview with a big tech company.
There are many variations of binary search that we implement depending on what the problem is asking you to do, but for now I think you should just implement a basic binary search.

Question 1 - https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/
(Problem : implement binary search)

Binary search is an awesome searching algorithm that can be implemented on sorted arrays only. It cuts search time from O(N) down to O(logN) which is huge in terms of time complexity!
If you don't understand time and space complexity I highly recommend the videos below.

Time and space are extremely important during the technical interview because you are essentially trying to find a solution to the problem with the best time and space complexities (Meaning fastest performing and least amount of extra space).
Try and really understand what binary search is doing and why it's a better solution to searching than a linear scan.
Now that we have a basic understanding of arrays, binary search, and time complexity we can move on to linked lists.

# Algorithm Challenges for Beginners - Linked Lists

I feel that Linked Lists are probably the next easiest data structure to learn and they're certainly important.

The only hard part about understanding Linked Lists is that they're weird. Up until now, unless you understand data structures, you probably haven't thought about how things are working behind the scenes when you write code. You just know that there are rules and techniques in programming and you follow the rules and use those techniques to solve problems.
If you understand data structures or linked lists maybe skip this part, but if you don't I definitely recommend watching these videos.

Without understanding linked lists and how we might be able to loop through them and access node values it might be difficult to do the problems below. Once you understand that a linked list is a bunch of connected nodes and once you know how traverse a linked list please try out the problems below.

Question 1 - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/print-the-elements-of-a-linked-list/problem
(Problem : Print the Elements of a Linked List)
Notes - Check the problem discussion boards out if you still don't understand

Question 2 - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-the-tail-of-a-linked-list/problem
(Problem : Insert a Node at the Tail of a Linked List)

Question 3 - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-the-head-of-a-linked-list/problem
(Problem : Insert a Node at the Head of a Linked List)

Linked List problems don’t come up very often in technical interviews, but they certainly could. They are one of the more simple problem types to master and expose you two other problem types such as “two pointer / slow & fast pointer” problems. Once you get used to them you might as well just sit down for a couple of days and go through them all! (all easy + medium ones)
